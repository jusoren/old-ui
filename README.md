# @jusoren/ui

This is **@jusoren/ui**, yet another React library. Actually, I want to use this library only for other personal projects. But, if this can be useful for people out there, why not?

## What's inside?

- `apps/docs`: the documentation site
- `packages/ui`: the library itself

## Running Locally

Run the following commands:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
